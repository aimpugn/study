## How to Prepare for a Release

### [Releasing Modules (v2 or Higher)](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#releasing-modules-v2-or-higher)

> For example,
> - if you are the author of *foo*,
> - and the latest tag for the *foo* repository is `v2.2.2`,
> - and *foo* has not yet adopted modules,
>
> then the best practice would be to use `v3.0.0` **for the first release** of *foo* to adopt modules (and hence the first release of *foo* to contain a `go.mod` file).
